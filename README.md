What is Ridge Regression?

**Rige Regression is a variation of Linear Regression**

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful linear model which predicts the dependent variable using linear combination of various independent variables.

Ridge regression is one of the simple techniques to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression.

***Ridge Regression : In ridge regression, the cost function is altered by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of the coefficients.
